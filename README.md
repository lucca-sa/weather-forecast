This project was created as a learning exercise, serving as a testament to my skills in web development. Utilizing a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies, I designed a responsive web application. The project showcases my ability to craft user-friendly interfaces that adapt seamlessly to both desktop and smartphone screens.
